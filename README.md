## Day 1
Our day started off in a very good way with the blessings of God. After that, we had our snacks and reached the auditorium at 10:30. We were given a very warm welcome at the college.

The speeches by the Principal and the other teachers were highly motivating and made us feel as if we were already a part of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College.

Shri Ravindra Garg, Shri Rakesh Kumar, and Shri Ashok Singla were our guests. They also inspired us with their speeches.

After that, we were given a tour of the Applied Science Department and its laboratories. The teachers there were very supportive and explained everything to us in detail.

## Day 2

Our next day begins with the English proficiency test. After that, we take the Maths proficiency test. Then it’s our break time, and at 1 o’clock, we head to the auditorium.

In the auditorium, we received a clear and detailed explanation about the Satya Scholarship, and we were guided on how to fill out the application form.

Then Dr. Arshdeep Singh delivered a lecture on food. He explained that food has a direct impact on a student’s mental health and emphasized the importance of eating nutritious food that supports our overall well-being. He patiently listened to all our doubts and answered them clearly. We really enjoyed and appreciated his lecture.
