## Day 1
Our day started off in a very good way with the blessings of God. After that, we had our snacks and reached the auditorium at 10:30. We were given a very warm welcome at the college.

The speeches by the Principal and the other teachers were highly motivating and made us feel as if we were already a part of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College.

Shri Ravindra Garg, Shri Rakesh Kumar, and Shri Ashok Singla were our guests. They also inspired us with their speeches.

After that, we were given a tour of the Applied Science Department and its laboratories. The teachers there were very supportive and explained everything to us in detail.
